# MGP-Seq
A python application for predicting DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences for genes in <i>Mus musculus.</i>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Download and install Python (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>) to your computer. MGP-Seq is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3. 

### Running MGP-Seq
MGP-Seq.py is the only file that needs to be downloaded from this repository. Python scripts can be run using the steps described <a href="http://www.cs.bu.edu/courses/cs108/guides/runpython.html">here.</a>

## Predicting Sequences

### Gene Sequences
1. Search for your desired gene at the top of the window
2. Select the output directory. All downloads/exports will direct here
3. Load in the Reference Gene
